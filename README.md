# First_App
This is my first android app I'm building for my church.
Version 1.0, not release ready.
I'm having some issues that tutorials and web searches have not been able to help me with.
Integrating a settings fragment so that I can offer multiple themes has had me stumped for some
time now.  I want to work through this one step at a time.  I started with the settings thinking
it would be relatively simple, but it's turning out to be more difficult.  Any help is appreciated,
but must be documented so that I may learn it, not just use your fix.  Understanding the relationship
and order of creation is one of my issues.  Thanks in advance, and please feel free to copy anything
that would assist you in your app development.
